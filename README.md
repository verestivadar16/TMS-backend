- TMS (Travel Meet Sold)

The purpose of the TMS (Travel Meet Sold) app is to bring together the features of various other apps in a simple, straightforward manner. The app's core is navigation, allowing you to use maps to navigate to your destination. This function is expanded upon with the ability to organize or join meetups with other users. Each user will have their own profile, which they can add photos and descriptions to. Users can follow each other and form friendships. Friends can view each other's locations on a map and trade with each other within the app's marketplace.
